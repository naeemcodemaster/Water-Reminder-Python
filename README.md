✅ Notes:  
- I’ve used your GitHub URL for the clone command.  
- The interval is set in the code (currently 1 minute for testing).  
- Instructions include running in dev mode and building `.exe`.  

If you want, I can also **add badges** for Python version, license, and PyPI package (`win11toast`) to make it look more professional like your Pomodoro README. Do you want me to do that next?
